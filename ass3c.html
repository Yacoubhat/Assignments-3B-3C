        task: Team<br>  After you have read this information, head over to the
        Assignment 3 Q&A discussion board to ask any questions and see what your
        peers are saying about this assignment.<br>  <h2>Assignment Details</h2> For the data
        visualisation website, it is expected that you program your
        visualisations in D3. However, if it becomes evident that you cannot
        achieve your vision using D3 in the time required, then other tools are
        acceptable. These need to be noted and fully justified in your
        submission. This assignment supports unit learning outcomes 1, 2, 3 and
        4. Website requirements The data visualisation website is a major part
        of this unit's assessment. It is expected that you program your
        visualisations in D3. However, if it becomes evident that you cannot
        achieve your vision using D3 in the time required, then other tools are
        acceptable. These need to be noted and fully justified in the
        submission. The assignment criteria provided for this assignment will
        help guide how you and your team structure and develop your final
        website. Most notably, you will be assessed on the complexity of your
        website and your implementation (build and aesthetic). The following
        table outlines the different levels of complexity and implementation you
        will be assessed on.<br />

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Complexity of project</td>
    <td>Very simple data set used and/or limited number of variables.</td>
    <td>Rich dataset used. The user is able to interact with one or more variables to explore the dataset.</td>
     <td>Multiple datasets used, datasets from different sources combined in new ways.

Some variables be derived or specially calculated for use in the visualisation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Implementation - Part 1</td>
    <td>One or more of the following:

no website built
no data visualisation evident
no interactivity website barely functional (i.e. data not displaying properly or interactivity not working as expected)
interactivity managed by changing webpages rather than in programming of visualisation.</td>
    <td>Website built and accessible on Mercury server.

Demonstrates some of the following as appropriate for context:

scalable labeled axis
data import
transitions
May have minor issues in functionality.

Demonstrates one or more of the following interactive features:

zoom
filter
brushing
details on demand
Code is well formed and commented.

Code from external sources is acknowledged and referenced.

Visualisation is presented with supporting context (i.e. page heading, explanatory text etc).</td>
     <td>As per good, plus:

Interactivity works as expected.

User is able to interact with one or more variables to explore dataset.

Shows a good response to original data visualisation questions.

Very good supporting context.

Largely programmed using D3.</td>
